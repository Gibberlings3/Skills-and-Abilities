<p>This mod has components (outlined above) requiring <a href="https://github.com/Bubb13/EEex/releases/latest">EEex</a> created by Bubb to work. If you install these components, you will need to launch your game with InfinityLoader.exe instead of the standard Baldur.exe file.</p>
<p>Being this requires EEex to run, Windows is required at this time.</p>
<h2 id="special-thanks">Special Thanks</h2>
