## Proficiencies

### Update Weapon Fighting Styles (2H Weapons, 1H Weapons, Sword & Shield)

**TWO-HANDED:** This fighting style allows the character to use a two-handed melee weapon and receive special bonuses.
- Proficient (1 slot): The wielder gets a +1 bonus to damage rolls and a -2 bonus to Speed Factor when using a two-handed weapon.
- Specialized (2 slots): The wielder gets a +2 bonus to damage rolls, a -4 bonus to Speed Factor, and an extra 0.5 attack per round when using a two-handed weapon.

**SWORD AND SHIELD:** Anyone can pick up a shield and get its basic protection bonuses, but by spending slots on this fighting style, an adventurer can maximize the benefits received.
- Proficient (1 slot): The wielder gets a -1 bonus to AC.

### Overhaul Proficiency System and Add Non-Weapon Proficiencies

## More Meaningful Stat Bonuses

## Compatibility
This mod has components (outlined above) requiring [EEex](https://github.com/Bubb13/EEex/releases/latest) created by Bubb to work. If you install these components, you will need to launch your game with InfinityLoader.exe instead of the standard Baldur.exe file.

Being this requires EEex to run, Windows is required at this time.

## Special Thanks

- Bubb for all of his work on EEex.
- aVENGER for use of a function to update clab files.
